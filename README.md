# Escape Shortcode

Escape shortcodes and other content so it's displayed exactly as shown while editing

- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/richjenks/wp-escape-shortcode)
- [Plugin page](https://richjenks.com/dev/wp/escape-shortcode/)

All credit goes to [Nick Iler](http://www.ilertech.com/2011/06/escape-wordpress-shortcodes-in-content-with-a-shortcode/) for writing the code which I wrapped in a plugin.

## Usage

Wrap `[esc]` and `[esc]` around content to escape and display it.
